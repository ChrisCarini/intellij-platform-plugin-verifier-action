# Usage
Add the action to your [GitHub Action Workflow file](https://help.github.com/en/actions/configuring-and-managing-workflows/configuring-a-workflow#creating-a-workflow-file) - the only thing you _need_ to specify are the JetBrains products & versions you wish to run against.

A minimal example of a workflow step is below:
```yaml
  - name: Verify Plugin on IntelliJ Platforms
    uses: ChrisCarini/intellij-platform-plugin-verifier-action@latest
    env:
      GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
    with:
      ide-versions: |
        ideaIC:2019.3
```

## Installation

1) Create a `.yml` (or `.yaml`) file in your GitHub repository's `.github/workflows` folder. We will call this file `compatibility.yml` below.
1) Copy the below contents into `compatibility.yml` 
    ```yaml
    name: IntelliJ Platform Plugin Compatibility
    
    on:
      push:
    
    jobs:
      compatibility:
        name: Ensure plugin compatibility against 2019.3 for IDEA Community, IDEA Ultimate, PyCharm Community, GoLand, CLion, and the latest EAP snapshot of IDEA Community.
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
        steps:
          - name: Check out repository
            uses: actions/checkout@v1
    
          - name: Setup Java 1.8
            uses: actions/setup-java@v1
            with:
              java-version: 1.8
    
          - name: Build the plugin using Gradle
            run: ./gradlew buildPlugin
    
          - name: Verify Plugin on IntelliJ Platforms
            id: verify
            uses: ChrisCarini/intellij-platform-plugin-verifier-action@latest
            env:
              GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
            with:
              ide-versions: |
                ideaIC:2019.3
                ideaIU:2019.3
                pycharmPC:2019.3
                goland:2019.3
                clion:2019.3
                ideaIC:LATEST-EAP-SNAPSHOT
    
          - name: Get log file path and print contents
            run: |
              echo "The verifier log file [${{steps.verify.outputs.verification-output-log-filename}}] contents : " ;
              cat ${{steps.verify.outputs.verification-output-log-filename}}
    ```

### GitHub Token Authentication

In order to
prevent [GitHub Rate limiting](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/overview/resources-in-the-rest-api#rate-limiting),
setting the `GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable is **highly** encouraged.

_**Without**_ the `GITHUB_TOKEN` set, the requests are considered 'unauthenticated requests' by the GitHub API, and are
subject to 60 requests per hour for the originating IP
address. [GitHub-hosted runners are hosted in Azure, and have the same IP address ranges as Azure datacenters.](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-github-hosted-runners/about-github-hosted-runners#ip-addresses)
As a side effect of this, if the particular IP address of the GitHub-runner executing your GitHub Workflow has made 60
requests per hour, the API call to resolve the latest version of the `intellij-plugin-verifier` will fail, and this
action will not complete successfully.

_**With**_ the `GITHUB_TOKEN`
set, [each repository using this GitHub action will be allowed 1,000 requests per hour](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/overview/resources-in-the-rest-api#rate-limiting)
(which is needed to resolve the latest version of the `intellij-plugin-verifier`). This should be ample for most
repositories.

## Options

This GitHub Action exposes 3 input options, only one of which is required.

| Input | Description | Usage | Default |
| :---: |  :--------- | :---: | :-----: |
| `verifier-version`  | The version of the [JetBrains intellij-plugin-verifier](https://github.com/JetBrains/intellij-plugin-verifier). The default of `LATEST` will automatically pull the most recently released version from GitHub - a specific version of the `intellij-plugin-verifier` can be optionally be pinned if desired. | *Optional* | `LATEST` |
| `plugin-location`  | The path to the `zip`-distribution of the plugin(s), generated by executing `./gradlew buildPlugin` | *Optional* | `build/distributions/*.zip` |
| `ide-versions`  | Releases of IntelliJ Platform IDEs and versions that should be used to validate against, formatted as a multi-line string as shown in the examples. Formatted as `<ide>:<version>` - see below for details. If you would prefer to have the list of IDE and versions stored in a file, see the **Configuration file for `<ide>:<version>`** section below for details. | *Required* | |
| `failure-levels`  | The different failure levels to set for the verifier. | *Required* | `COMPATIBILITY_PROBLEMS INVALID_PLUGIN`|

An example using all the available options is below:
```yaml
  - name: Verify Plugin on IntelliJ Platforms
    id: verify
    uses: ChrisCarini/intellij-platform-plugin-verifier-action@latest
    env:
      GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
    with:
      verifier-version: '1.255'
      plugin-location: 'build/distributions/sample-intellij-plugin-*.zip'
      ide-versions: |
        ideaIC:LATEST-EAP-SNAPSHOT
      failure-levels: |
        COMPATIBILITY_PROBLEMS
        INVALID_PLUGIN
        NOT_DYNAMIC
``` 

### `verifier-version`

This optional input allows users to pin a specific version of `intellij-plugin-verifier` to be used during validation.

**WARNING:** Due to the deprecation fo Bintray services on 2021-05-01, JetBrains moved the verifier artifacts to their own
Maven repository (
See [`intellij-plugin-verifier` version `1.255` release notes](https://github.com/JetBrains/intellij-plugin-verifier/releases/tag/v1.255)
for details.). If you wish to specify a `verifier-version` in this GitHub Action, please ensure you are using **both**:
1) `intellij-plugin-verifier` version `1.255` or later

    **AND**

2) `intellij-platform-plugin-verifier-action` version `2.0.0` or later

### `plugin-location`

This optional input allows users to specify a different location for the plugin(s) `.zip` file. The default 
assumes that [gradle-intellij-plugin](https://github.com/JetBrains/gradle-intellij-plugin/) is being used to build
 the plugin(s).

### `ide-versions`

This required input sets which IDEs and versions the plugins will be validated against.

You can identify the value for `<ide>` and `<version>` as follows.

1) Navigate to the [IntelliJ Releases Repository](https://www.jetbrains.com/intellij-repository/releases/)
1) Find the IDE and version you wish to use.
1) Copy the URL for the `.zip`.
1) Take **only** the `.zip` filename from the URL; example below:
    ```
    https://www.jetbrains.com/intellij-repository/releases/com/jetbrains/intellij/pycharm/pycharmPY/2019.3/pycharmPY-2019.3.zip
   ```
    becomes
    ```
    pycharmPY-2019.3.zip
    ```
1) Replace the `-` with a `:`, and remove the `.zip` from the end; example below:
    ```
    pycharmPY-2019.3.zip
   ```
    becomes
    ```
    pycharmPY:2019.3
    ```
1) This is the value you will use in `ide-versions`.

#### Some `<ide>` options
* [CLion](https://www.jetbrains.com/clion/) = `clion`
* [GoLand](https://www.jetbrains.com/go/) = `goland`
* [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/)
    * IntelliJ IDEA Community = `ideaIC`
    * IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate = `ideaIU`
* [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/)
    * PyCharm Community = `pycharmPC`
    * PyCharm Professional = `pycharmPY`
* [Rider](https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/) = `riderRD`

#### Some `<version>` options
* Major versions (ie, `2019.3`)
* Minor versions (ie, `2019.3.4`)
* Specific build versions (ie, `193.6911.18`)
* `SNAPSHOT` versions
    * versions ending in `*-SNAPSHOT`
    * versions ending in `*-EAP-SNAPSHOT`
    * versions ending in `*-EAP-CANDIDATE-SNAPSHOT`
    * versions ending in `*-CUSTOM-SNAPSHOT`
* Latest EAP version (ie, `LATEST-EAP-SNAPSHOT`)

#### Configuration file for `<ide>:<version>`
If you would like to keep your GitHub Action workflow file tidy and free from constant changes, you can pass a relative 
file path to a file containing the IDE and versions. Below are the respective excerpts to use this feature.

**Workflow File:**
```yaml
- uses: actions/checkout@v2 # Your repository must be checked out in order to access the `ide_versions_file.txt` configuration file.
- name: Verify plugin on IntelliJ Platforms
  id: verify
  uses: ChrisCarini/intellij-platform-plugin-verifier-action@latest
  env:
    GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
  with:
    ide-versions: .github/workflows/ide_versions_file.txt
```
**`.github/workflows/ide_versions_file.txt`**
```
ideaIC:2019.3
ideaIU:2019.3
pycharmPC:2019.3
goland:2019.3
clion:2019.3
ideaIC:LATEST-EAP-SNAPSHOT
```

(**Note:** The sample above will yield an execution identical to the one provided in the `Installation` section above.)

### `failure-levels`

This required input sets which plugin verifier failures to cause a failure in this action.

#### Valid options
|           Value           |  Search String                                                             |
| :-------------------------| :------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| COMPATIBILITY_WARNINGS    | "Compatibility warnings"                                                   |
| COMPATIBILITY_PROBLEMS    | "Compatibility problems"                                                   |
| DEPRECATED_API_USAGES     | "Deprecated API usages"                                                    |
| EXPERIMENTAL_API_USAGES   | "Experimental API usages"                                                  |
| INTERNAL_API_USAGES       | "Internal API usages"                                                      |
| OVERRIDE_ONLY_API_USAGES  | "Override-only API usages"                                                 |
| NON_EXTENDABLE_API_USAGES | "Non-extendable API usages"                                                |
| PLUGIN_STRUCTURE_WARNINGS | "Plugin structure warnings"                                                |
| MISSING_DEPENDENCIES      | "Missing dependencies"                                                     |
| INVALID_PLUGIN            | "The following files specified for the verification are not valid plugins" |
| NOT_DYNAMIC               | "Plugin cannot be loaded/unloaded without IDE restart"                     |

**Note:** The default values are `COMPATIBILITY_PROBLEMS` and `INVALID_PLUGIN` for backwards compatibility. These were
the two default checks as of authoring this capability. This may change in the future, but a minor version bump (at a
minimum) will happen should that occur.

## Results
The results of the execution are captured in a file for use in subsequent steps if you so choose.

You will need to give the `intellij-platform-plugin-verifier-action` step an `id`.

You can then access the verifier output file by using `${{steps.<id>.outputs.verification-output-log-filename}}`.

In the below example, we use set the `id` to `verify` - this example will print the filename as well as the contents of the file as a subsequent step to the validation:

```yaml
      - name: Verify Plugin on IntelliJ Platforms
        id: verify
        uses: ChrisCarini/intellij-platform-plugin-verifier-action@latest
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
        with:
          ide-versions: |
            ideaIC:2019.3

      - name: Get log file path and print contents
        run: |
          echo "The verifier log file [${{steps.verify.outputs.verification-output-log-filename}}] contents : " ;
          cat ${{steps.verify.outputs.verification-output-log-filename}}
```

(**Note:** The file contents will include both `stdout` and `stderr` output from the plugin verification CLI.)
